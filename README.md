RUDRA

RUDRA is an SMT-based tool that  automatically and transparently injects concurrency control into a Ruby on Rails  application, to ensure they execute correctly in geo-distributed environments with replicated data store. 
A successful analysis proves that a given program will maintain its integrity invariants. If not, the tool provides a counter-example, which the program developer can examine, in order to adjust the program design either by weakening application semantics, and/or by adding concurrency controls, in order to disallow toxic concurrency.    


Requirements: 
 1) Z3 SAT solver librray
 2) Antrl4 Runtime
